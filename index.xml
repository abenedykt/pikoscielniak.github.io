      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s quite common to have New Year’s Resolutions and I’m not the only one doing this.
One of my New Year’s resolutions is to improve my English writing skills. The second one is starting my own blog.
So, I decided to combine these two things together.
My main goal for having my own blog is to create a base of my own knowledge and make it publicly accessible.
Up to now, I had my notes in Evernote and I used this tool to store my thoughts.
The majority of my notes are private. I am afraid to make them public because of the quality of my writing,
I’m not confident that they are well written. I believe that making my
notes public on my blog will force me to improve them. I will see how that turns out in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main point of interest is mainly programming. I work as a C# ASP .NET and JavaScript developer.
Currently, I’m also playing with Angular 2, TypeScript and with Go. I’m also interested in TDD, DDD and Agile.
I am keen on writing effective and maintainable code which fulfills the customer’s needs.
Most of my posts will be related to these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I want to have this blog not only as my personal knowledge base but also as an area where
I can express my thoughts about various topics and things which have happened to me.
My initial goal is to write and publish one post per month but I will see, maybe it will be more.
I hope that this blog will bring joy not only for me but also for other people. So, welcome to my blog world.&lt;/p&gt;
