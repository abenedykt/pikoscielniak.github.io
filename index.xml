      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dajsiepoznac.pl&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://koscielniak.me/post/2016/03/contestLogo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Daj się poznać&#34; title=&#34;Daj się poznać&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first post in the series “Daj się poznać”.
I am going to mention the details of the project which I’ll be working on during the contest.
I am going to create a simple yet powerful application which will allow me to add some events
and notify me about them at a specific time via a specified medium.
For starters, I am planing to implement sms and email notification but maybe in the future
I’ll add the ability to send notifications to some IoT device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to implement this application in a way which allows me to upgrade ASP .NET Core 1.0
framework very quickly. This framework is brand new and it’s quite probable that some breaking
changes will appear in the next release. So I cannot depend on it very much.
I hope that ASP .NET Core 1.0 will have a lot of versions in the future but
I don’t want to have a nightmare during upgrading to a newer version. Therefore,
I must use architecture which prepares me for this. I don’t know exactly what this architecture
will look like but I’ll write about it in future posts as the project will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement my project I need some sort of membership system for cases like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can sign in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can sign up (I am not sure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can sign out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other use cases which I am going to implement are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can create event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can add notification to event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can add related persons to event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can see list of events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can delete event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user can change event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sending notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll write more details about use cases and their implementation in future posts, but before I do this, I’ll write something about installation ASP .NET Core 1.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 and running the first web application in this operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Maciej Aniserowicz wrote on his blog about starting the second edition of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maciejaniserowicz.com/daj-sie-poznac/&#34;&gt;“Daj się poznać”&lt;/a&gt;
competition. I’ve decided to take part in this challenge.
I started my blog over three weeks ago and since then I have made two posts.
I think that taking part in this contest will encourage me to have a more systematic approach to my blog.
I think this contest will be a lot of fun and provide a lot of opportunities for me to learn new things.
For the competition I am required to write an average of two articles a week for three months (minimum 10 weeks),
and this seems like a big deal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest will run from March to May and the winners will be announced in June.
Writing a blog is only one part of this undertaking, the other is completing a project and all blog posts must be
related to this project. I haven’t decided what my project will be but I have the whole of February to brainstorm.
I know that I want to learn and try some new technologies, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://get.asp.net/&#34;&gt;ASP .NET Core 1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://angular.io/&#34;&gt;Angular 2&lt;/a&gt;, and this project will be a good occasion to do this.
Maybe I will also try to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com&#34;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; or another cloud computing platform.
We’ll see, but for sure I want to gain a lot experience from this project.
Additionally, I am going to do this project on Ubuntu 14.04.
ASP .NET Core 1 is a cross-platform framework and I am going to try it out on environments other than Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I’ll be treating this competition as source for many challenges: experiencing new technologies,
regular blogging, and systematic work on my “side project”.
Everything that I am going to use is currently in the Beta stage, so this is another challenge for me.
We will see what happens in June. I hope this will be great fun and that I will have a lot of great experiences,
so&amp;hellip;let’s do it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About Boiling Frogs</title>
      <link>http://koscielniak.me/post/2016/01/about-boiling-frogs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2016 13:33:18 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://koscielniak.me/post/2016/01/about-boiling-frogs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve noticed that I am becoming a conference beast. In the last year, I have attended six conferences
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://wrocsharp.com/&#34;&gt;Wroc#&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://2015.dwo.mikstura.it/&#34;&gt;DWO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://devoxx.pl/&#34;&gt;DEVOXX&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://qualityexcites.pl&#34;&gt;Quality Excites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://devday.pl/&#34;&gt;DevDay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://spreadit.pl/&#34;&gt;SpreadIT&lt;/a&gt;)
and five different meetups.
Additionally, this year I may attend even more because new ones have appeared on my conference calendar.
The first conference for me last year was Wroc#. It was an excellent conference.
I can honestly say that this was one of the best conferences I’ve ever been to.
In 2016, I started with another conference - &lt;a href=&#34;http://boilingfrogs.pl/&#34;&gt;Boiling Frogs&lt;/a&gt;, which ended last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference &amp;ldquo;Boiling Frogs&amp;rdquo; was powered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://itcorner.org.pl/&#34;&gt;ITCorner - Wroclaw Fellowship of Technology&lt;/a&gt;.
Each presentation at this conference was given by a Polish speaker in Polish.
This event was a good occasion for less known speakers to appear in front of a wider audience, 450 attendees to be exact.
In my opinion, this was a great turn out for their first event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sessions were presented in three parallel tracks, and only the first presentation was made to the whole audience.
It was given by &lt;a href=&#34;http://boilingfrogs.pl/speaker/tomasz-kaczmarzyk/&#34;&gt;Tomasz Kaczmarzyk&lt;/a&gt;, a co-organizer of this conference.
He spoke about the idea behind the conference and about its name.
The name “Boiling Frogs” was taken from the experiment with a boiling frog in a pot.
When we increase the temperature slowly enough, we will be able to boil a frog and it won’t even notice that
it is being boiled. He compared the situation of the frog to a programmer
who is doing their daily tasks without bothering to improve their knowledge and skills and suddenly
they realise that the world has changed. Only then do they realise that they have been boiled, but
it’s too late to jump out. The main idea of these organizers was to alert participants that maybe their pots have
already reached 60 C°, and there is still enough time to jump out of the pot, and change their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the temperature in my pot is not very hot but I may be wrong. Anyway,
I had the great pleasure of taking part in “Boiling Frogs” and I learned some new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the speech given by &lt;a href=&#34;http://boilingfrogs.pl/speaker/bartek-zdanowski/&#34;&gt;Bartek Zdanowski&lt;/a&gt; “Developer, develop yourself”,
I confronted my path of developing myself with the one proposed by Bartek Zdanowski.
And it turned out that they are quite similar, with the exception that I’ve never been keen on hackathons but
Bartek showed that hackathons can be an exciting form of self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the speech given by the co-host of this conference - Tomasz Kaczmarzyk. He talked about pure functional
data structures. I was afraid that it would be a hard presentation that would hurt my brain,
but it turned out that the speaker had a clear path for his speech and delivered it quite smoothly.
Tomasz started his speech with a short theoretical introduction and after this showed us a practical use of
functional structures in GIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Tomasz’s speech, there was a dinner break. I heard that they served 4000 dumplings during this dinner - pretty amazing,
isn’t it? After dinner, I chose to see what &lt;a href=&#34;http://boilingfrogs.pl/speaker/michal-gruca/&#34;&gt;Michał Gruca&lt;/a&gt; had to say. I saw him at the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.33degree.org&#34;&gt;33rd Degree conference&lt;/a&gt;,
where he spoke about the mythical 10 times developer. I really enjoyed that presentation, so I expected the same
at &amp;ldquo;Boiling Frogs&amp;rdquo;, and he didn’t disappoint. This was the perfect after-dinner presentation.
I listened to him weave a tale that didn’t include dragons, but another mythical and fantastic creature&amp;hellip;the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to that lecture, was a presentation given by &lt;a href=&#34;http://boilingfrogs.pl/speaker/pawel-lipinski/&#34;&gt;Paweł Lipiński&lt;/a&gt;.
This one was perfect for the end of the conference. The speaker didn’t bother to prepare slides for his presentation.
He had one for the introduction and then he pulled out his analogue slides (I mean small, yellow index cards)
where he had written bullet points of his presentation and he led us from one point to the other and delivered a very
nice and wise story, in this manner. Examples from Paweł’s speech turned out to be very handy for me at work on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard a lot of talk about a speech given by &lt;a href=&#34;http://boilingfrogs.pl/speaker/michal-plachta/&#34;&gt;Michał Płachta&lt;/a&gt; titled “Paradise for polyglots - panta rei”.
I hope that the organisers make it available to the public, so I can watch it and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the inaugural conference for &amp;ldquo;Boiling Frogs&amp;rdquo;, and I hope it won’t be the last and that the organizers
will manage to repeat this event next year. So, to the conference organisers: best wishes and good luck.
See you next year! And to you my readers: see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to my blog world</title>
      <link>http://koscielniak.me/post/2016/01/hello-blog-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 21:54:18 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://koscielniak.me/post/2016/01/hello-blog-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s quite common to have New Year’s Resolutions and I’m not the only one doing this.
One of my New Year’s resolutions is to improve my English writing skills. The second one is starting my own blog.
So, I decided to combine these two things together.
My main goal for having my own blog is to create a base of my own knowledge and make it publicly accessible.
Up to now, I had my notes in Evernote and I used this tool to store my thoughts.
The majority of my notes are private. I am afraid to make them public because of the quality of my writing,
I’m not confident that they are well written. I believe that making my
notes public on my blog will force me to improve them. I will see how that turns out in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main point of interest is mainly programming. I work as a C# ASP .NET and JavaScript developer.
Currently, I’m also playing with Angular 2, TypeScript and Go. I’m also interested in TDD, DDD and Agile.
I am keen on writing effective and maintainable code which fulfills the customer’s needs.
Most of my posts will be related to these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I want to have this blog not only as my personal knowledge base but also as an area where
I can express my thoughts about various topics and things which have happened to me.
My initial goal is to write and publish one post per month but I will see, maybe it will be more.
I hope that this blog will bring joy not only for me but also for other people. So, welcome to my blog world.&lt;/p&gt;
